Please, give a :star:. It'll go a long way.


## How To Use
Ensure you have the latest version of Python installed. Go to [https://python.org/downloads](https://python.org/downloads) to download the latest release for your local computer.

1. Create a new virtual environment ->

```bash
virtualenv image_recognition_with_python_env
```

Note: If you do not have `virtualenv` installed (you'll know if the command above outputs an error), install `virtualenv` with ->

```bash
$ pip install virtualenv
```



2. Clone this repository ->

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Icheka/Image-Recognition-Using-Python-OpenCV.git
```



3. Enter the newly created virtual environment and start it up ->

On Windows (using a bash shell like Git Bash):
```bash
$ source scripts/activate
```
On Windows (using Command Prompt):
```bash
$ source \Scripts\activate
```

On Linux:
```bash
$ source scripts/activate
```

A similar command exists for MacOS. A quick web search for "How To Activate Virtualenv on MacOS" will help.




4. Install the required Python modules -> 

```bash
$ pip install requirements.txt
```



5. Start the app ->

```bash
$ python main.py
```



6. Quit the app -> 

Hit Ctrl + C (Windows) or Cmd + C (MacOS) or the correct keyboard interrupt combination for your operating system.
